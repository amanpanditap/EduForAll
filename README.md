# EduForAll - Solving the Education Accessibilty.
## A Proposal for the Community Development Project.

### About:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the advent of internet, free high-quality education is now in abundace, although a vast majority of people still struggle to have access to high-speed stable internet. This potentially hampers the growth of primarily rural students who have to resort to studying by the methods of days of Yore. This project aims to solve that problem.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**EduForAll** is a Django Web App built to be hosted completely offline - on a LAN network providing features of getting Study Resources, taking chapterwise Tests and maintaining a Forum for the students to ask and answer each others' doubts within the Network. Further plans for the project are to also include Video Lectures by erudite Professors from around the globe.
